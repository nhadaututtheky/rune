## Conventions

- Every skill MUST have a SKILL.md following docs/SKILL-TEMPLATE.md
- Skill names: lowercase kebab-case, max 64 chars
- Layer rules: L1 calls L2/L3. L2 calls L2/L3. L3 calls nothing.
- Model selection: haiku (scan), sonnet (code), opus (architecture)
- Commit messages: conventional commits (feat, fix, docs, chore)

## Commands

- Validate plugin: `claude plugin validate .`
