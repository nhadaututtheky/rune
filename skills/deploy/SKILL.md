# deploy

## Purpose

Deploy applications to target platforms. Handles the full deployment flow — environment configuration, build, push, verification, and rollback if needed. Supports Vercel, Netlify, AWS, GCP, DigitalOcean, and custom VPS via SSH.

<HARD-GATE>
- Tests MUST pass (via `rune:verification`) before deploy runs
- Sentinel MUST pass (no CRITICAL issues) before deploy runs
- Both are non-negotiable. Failure = stop + report, never skip
</HARD-GATE>

## Called By (inbound)

- `launch` (L1): deployment phase of launch pipeline
- User: `/rune deploy` direct invocation

## Calls (outbound)

- `verification` (L2): pre-deploy tests + build check
- `sentinel` (L2): pre-deploy security scan
- `browser-pilot` (L3): verify live deployment visually
- `watchdog` (L3): setup post-deploy monitoring

## Cross-Hub Connections

- `deploy` → `verification` — pre-deploy tests + build must pass
- `deploy` → `sentinel` — security must pass before push

## Execution Steps

### Step 1 — Pre-deploy checks (HARD-GATE)

Call `rune:verification` to run the full test suite and build.

```
If verification fails → STOP. Do NOT proceed. Report failure with test output.
```

Call `rune:sentinel` to run security scan.

```
If sentinel returns CRITICAL issues → STOP. Do NOT proceed. Report issues.
```

Both gates MUST pass. No exceptions.

### Step 2 — Detect platform

Use `Bash` to inspect the project root for platform config files:

```bash
ls vercel.json netlify.toml Dockerfile fly.toml 2>/dev/null
cat package.json | grep -A5 '"scripts"'
```

Map findings to platform:

| File found | Platform |
|---|---|
| `vercel.json` | Vercel |
| `netlify.toml` | Netlify |
| `fly.toml` | Fly.io |
| `Dockerfile` | Docker / VPS |
| `package.json` deploy script | npm deploy |

If no config found, ask the user which platform to target before continuing.

### Step 3 — Deploy

Use `Bash` to run the platform-specific deploy command:

| Platform | Command |
|---|---|
| Vercel | `vercel --prod` |
| Netlify | `netlify deploy --prod` |
| Fly.io | `fly deploy` |
| Docker | `docker build -t app . && docker push <registry>/app` |
| npm script | `npm run deploy` |

Capture full command output. Extract deployed URL from output.

### Step 4 — Verify deployment

Use `Bash` to check the deployed URL returns HTTP 200:

```bash
curl -o /dev/null -s -w "%{http_code}" <deployed-url>
```

If status is not 200 → flag as WARNING, do not treat as hard failure unless 5xx.

If `rune:browser-pilot` is available, call it to take a screenshot of the deployed URL for visual confirmation.

### Step 5 — Monitor

Call `rune:watchdog` to set up post-deploy monitoring alerts on the deployed URL.

### Step 6 — Report

Output the deploy report:

```
## Deploy Report
- **Platform**: [target]
- **Status**: success | failed | rollback
- **URL**: [deployed URL]
- **Build Time**: [duration]

### Checks
- Tests: passed | failed
- Security: passed | failed ([count] issues)
- HTTP Status: [code]
- Visual: [screenshot path if browser-pilot ran]
- Monitoring: active | skipped
```

If any step failed, include the error output and recommended next action.

## Cost Profile

~1000-3000 tokens input, ~500-1000 tokens output. Sonnet. Most time in build/deploy commands.
