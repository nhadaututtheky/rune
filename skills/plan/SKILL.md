# plan

## Purpose

Create structured implementation plans from requirements. Plan is the strategic brain of the Rune ecosystem — it breaks complex tasks into phased implementation steps, identifies dependencies and risks, and makes architecture decisions. Uses opus for deep reasoning quality. Bidirectionally connected with brainstorm for creative exploration.

## Triggers

- Called by `cook` when task scope > 1 file
- Called by `team` for high-level task decomposition
- `/rune plan <task>` — manual planning
- Auto-trigger: when user says "implement", "build", "create" with complex scope

## Calls (outbound)

- `scout` (L2): scan codebase for existing patterns, conventions, and structure
- `brainstorm` (L2): when multiple valid approaches exist and creative exploration needed
- `research` (L3): external knowledge lookup for unfamiliar technologies
- `sequential-thinking` (L3): complex architecture with many trade-offs

## Called By (inbound)

- `cook` (L1): Phase 2 PLAN — create implementation plan
- `team` (L1): high-level task decomposition into parallel workstreams
- `brainstorm` (L2): when idea is selected and needs structuring into actionable plan
- `rescue` (L1): plan refactoring strategy for legacy modules
- User: `/rune plan <task>` direct invocation

## Cross-Hub Connections

- `plan` ↔ `brainstorm` — bidirectional: plan asks brainstorm for creative options, brainstorm asks plan for structure

## Executable Steps

### Step 1 — Gather Context
Use findings from `rune:scout` if already available. If not, invoke `rune:scout` with the project root to scan directory structure, detect framework, identify key files, and extract existing patterns. Do NOT skip this step — plans without context produce wrong file paths.

### Step 2 — Decompose the Task
Break the task into ordered, atomic steps. Each step must specify:
- Exact file path(s) to touch (absolute paths, not relative)
- What to add, change, or delete in each file
- Which function/class/component is affected
- Order of operations (respect dependency graph — create dependencies before consumers)

### Step 3 — Identify Risks
For each step, assess:
- **Breaking changes**: does this modify a public API, exported function, or shared type?
- **Dependencies**: does this step require another step to complete first?
- **Test coverage gaps**: which changed code paths have no existing tests?
- **External dependencies**: new packages required? version conflicts?

Flag every risk explicitly. Do not silently assume it is safe.

### Step 4 — Write the Plan (with tests)
Format each phase as:
```
Phase N: [name]
- Files: [absolute paths]
- Changes: [what to implement]
- Tests: [test file path + test cases to write]
- Complexity: low | medium | high
- Risks: [identified risks from Step 3]
```

<HARD-GATE>
Every phase that writes production code MUST have a corresponding test entry. A plan with zero test steps is REJECTED — do not present it to the user.
</HARD-GATE>

If multiple approaches are viable, invoke `rune:brainstorm` before writing the plan. If trade-offs involve complex architectural reasoning, invoke `rune:sequential-thinking`.

### Step 5 — Present and Get Approval
Present the full plan to the user. Do NOT begin execution. Wait for explicit approval ("yes", "go", "proceed", "looks good") before handing the plan to the caller (e.g., `cook`) for execution.

If the user requests changes, revise the plan and re-present. Do not skip re-presentation after revisions.

## Constraints

1. MUST include exact file paths for every phase — no vague "set up the database"
2. MUST include acceptance criteria for every phase — how do we know it's done?
3. MUST include test entries for every phase that produces code — plans with zero tests are rejected
4. MUST order phases by dependency — don't plan step 3 before step 1's output exists
5. MUST NOT produce plans with fewer than 3 phases for non-trivial tasks
6. MUST get user approval before the plan is executed

## Output Format

```
## Implementation Plan: [Task Name]

### Architecture Decision
- **Approach**: [chosen approach]
- **Rationale**: [why this approach]
- **Alternatives considered**: [other options and why rejected]

### Dependencies
- [dependency] — [status: available | needs setup]

### Phases
1. **Phase 1: [name]** — [description]
   - Files: [absolute paths]
   - Changes: [what to implement]
   - Tests: [test file path + test cases]
   - Complexity: low | medium | high
   - Risks: [risks]

2. **Phase 2: [name]** — [description]
   ...

### Risks
- [risk] — [mitigation]

### Success Criteria
- [ ] [criterion 1]
- [ ] [criterion 2]

### Awaiting Approval
Reply "go" to execute, or describe changes needed.

## Cost Profile

~3000-8000 tokens input, ~1000-3000 tokens output. Opus for architectural reasoning quality. Most expensive L2 skill but runs infrequently.
