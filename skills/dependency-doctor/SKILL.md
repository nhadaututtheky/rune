# dependency-doctor

## Purpose

Dependency management covering health checks, safe updates, conflict resolution, and cleanup. Checks for outdated packages, known vulnerabilities, license issues, and unused dependencies.

## Triggers

- Called by sentinel for dependency audit
- Called by cook during project setup phase

## Calls (outbound)

None — pure L3 utility using Bash for package manager commands.

## Called By (inbound)

- `sentinel` (L2): dependency audit as part of security gate
- `cook` (L1): setup phase dependency check
- `rescue` (L1): Phase 0 dependency health assessment

## Capabilities

```
HEALTH CHECK    — list deps with versions, flag outdated/deprecated/CVE
SAFE UPDATE     — update one package at a time, run tests after each
CONFLICT FIX    — identify version conflicts, suggest resolutions
CLEANUP         — find unused deps, duplicates, lighter alternatives
```

## Output Format

```
## Dependency Report
- **Total**: [count] | **Outdated**: [count] | **Vulnerable**: [count]

### Critical (CVE)
- [package]@[version] — [CVE ID]: [description]

### Outdated
- [package]@[current] → [latest] ([major|minor|patch])

### Unused
- [package] — no imports found

### Recommendations
- [action items]
```

## Cost Profile

~300-600 tokens input, ~200-500 tokens output. Haiku. Most time in package manager commands.
