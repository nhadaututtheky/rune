# sentinel

## Purpose

Automated security gatekeeper that blocks unsafe code BEFORE commit. Unlike `review` which suggests improvements, sentinel is a hard gate — it BLOCKS on critical findings. Runs secret scanning, OWASP top 10 pattern detection, dependency auditing, and destructive command checks. Escalates to opus for deep security audit when critical patterns detected.

<HARD-GATE>
If status is BLOCK, output the report and STOP. Do not hand off to commit. The calling skill (`cook`, `preflight`, `deploy`) must halt until the developer fixes all BLOCK findings and re-runs sentinel.
</HARD-GATE>

## Triggers

- Called automatically by `cook` before commit phase
- Called by `preflight` as security sub-check
- Called by `deploy` before deployment
- `/rune sentinel` — manual security scan
- Auto-trigger: when `.env`, auth files, or security-critical code is modified

## Calls (outbound)

- `scout` (L2): scan changed files to identify security-relevant code
- `verification` (L3): run security tools (npm audit, pip audit, cargo audit)

## Called By (inbound)

- `cook` (L1): auto-trigger before commit phase
- `review` (L2): when security-critical code detected
- `deploy` (L2): pre-deployment security check
- `preflight` (L2): security sub-check in quality gate

## Severity Levels

```
BLOCK    — commit MUST NOT proceed (secrets found, critical CVE, SQL injection)
WARN     — commit can proceed but developer must acknowledge (medium CVE, missing validation)
INFO     — informational finding, no action required (best practice suggestion)
```

## Security Patterns (built-in)

```
# Secret patterns (regex)
AWS_KEY:        AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}
GITHUB_TOKEN:   gh[ps]_[A-Za-z0-9_]{36,}
GENERIC_SECRET: (?i)(api[_-]?key|secret|password|token)\s*[:=]\s*["'][^"']{8,}
HIGH_ENTROPY:   [A-Za-z0-9+/=]{40,}  (entropy > 4.5)

# OWASP patterns
SQL_INJECTION:  string concat/interpolation in SQL context
XSS:            innerHTML, dangerouslySetInnerHTML, document.write
CSRF:           form without CSRF token, missing SameSite cookie
```

## Executable Steps

### Step 1 — Secret Scan
Use `Grep` to search all changed files (or full codebase if no diff available) for secret patterns:
- Patterns: `sk-`, `AKIA`, `ghp_`, `ghs_`, `-----BEGIN`, `password\s*=\s*["']`, `secret\s*=\s*["']`, `api_key\s*=\s*["']`, `token\s*=\s*["']`
- Also scan for `.env` file contents committed directly (grep for lines matching `KEY=value` outside `.env` files)
- Flag any string with entropy > 4.5 and length > 40 characters as HIGH_ENTROPY candidate

Any match = **BLOCK**. Do not proceed to later steps if BLOCK findings exist — report immediately.

### Step 2 — Dependency Audit
Use `Bash` to run the appropriate audit command for the detected package manager:
- npm/pnpm/yarn: `npm audit --json` (parse JSON, extract critical + high severity)
- Python: `pip-audit --format=json` (if installed) or `safety check`
- Rust: `cargo audit --json`
- Go: `govulncheck ./...`

Critical CVE (CVSS >= 9.0) = **BLOCK**. High CVE (CVSS 7.0–8.9) = **WARN**. Medium/Low = **INFO**.

If audit tool is not installed, log **INFO**: "audit tool not found, skipping dependency check" — do NOT block on missing tooling.

### Step 3 — OWASP Check
Use `Read` to scan changed files for:
- **SQL Injection**: string concatenation or interpolation inside SQL query strings (e.g., `"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " + userId`, f-strings with SQL). Flag = **BLOCK**
- **XSS**: `innerHTML =`, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, `document.write(` with non-static content. Flag = **BLOCK**
- **CSRF**: HTML `<form>` elements without CSRF token fields; `Set-Cookie` headers without `SameSite`. Flag = **WARN**
- **Missing input validation**: new route handlers or API endpoints that directly pass `req.body` / `request.json()` to a database call without a validation schema. Flag = **WARN**

### Step 4 — Permission Check
Use `Grep` to scan for:
- Destructive shell commands in scripts: `rm -rf /`, `DROP TABLE`, `DELETE FROM` without `WHERE`, `TRUNCATE`
- File operations using absolute paths outside the project root (e.g., `/etc/`, `/usr/`, `C:\Windows\`)
- Direct production database connection strings (e.g., `prod`, `production` in DB host names)

Destructive command on production path = **BLOCK**. Suspicious path = **WARN**.

### Step 5 — Report
Aggregate all findings. Apply the verdict rule:
- Any **BLOCK** finding → overall status = **BLOCK**. List all BLOCK items first.
- No BLOCK but any **WARN** → overall status = **WARN**. Developer must acknowledge each WARN.
- Only **INFO** → overall status = **PASS**.

If status is BLOCK, output the report and STOP. Do not hand off to commit. The calling skill (`cook`, `preflight`, `deploy`) must halt until the developer fixes all BLOCK findings and re-runs sentinel.

## Output Format

```
## Sentinel Report
- **Status**: PASS | WARN | BLOCK
- **Files Scanned**: [count]
- **Findings**: [count by severity]

### BLOCK (must fix before commit)
- `path/to/file.ts:42` — Hardcoded API key detected (pattern: sk-...)
- `path/to/api.ts:15` — SQL injection: string concatenation in query

### WARN (must acknowledge)
- `package.json` — lodash@4.17.20 has known prototype pollution (CVE-2021-23337, CVSS 7.4)

### INFO
- `auth.ts:30` — Consider adding rate limiting to login endpoint

### Verdict
BLOCKED — 2 critical findings must be resolved before commit.
```

## Constraints

1. MUST scan ALL files in scope — not just the file the user pointed at
2. MUST check: hardcoded secrets, SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, auth bypass, path traversal
3. MUST list every file checked in the report — "no issues found" requires proof of what was examined
4. MUST NOT say "the framework handles security" as justification for skipping checks
5. MUST NOT say "this is an internal tool" as justification for reduced security
6. MUST flag any .env, credentials, or key files found in git-tracked directories
7. MUST use opus model for security-critical code (auth, crypto, payments)

## Cost Profile

~1000-3000 tokens input, ~500-1000 tokens output. Sonnet default, opus for deep audit on critical findings.
