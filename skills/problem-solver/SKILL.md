# problem-solver

## Purpose

Structured reasoning utility for problems that resist straightforward analysis. Receives a problem statement, selects the appropriate analytical framework, applies it step-by-step with evidence, and returns ranked solutions. Stateless — no memory between calls.

## Calls (outbound)

None — pure L3 reasoning utility.

## Called By (inbound)

- `debug` (L2): complex bugs that resist standard debugging
- `brainstorm` (L2): structured frameworks for creative exploration

## Execution

### Input

```
problem: string         — clear statement of the problem to analyze
context: string         — (optional) relevant background, constraints, symptoms observed
goal: string            — (optional) desired outcome or success criteria
```

### Step 1 — Receive Problem Statement

Read the `problem` and `context` inputs. Restate the problem in one sentence to confirm understanding before applying any framework. If the problem statement is ambiguous, identify the most likely interpretation and state it explicitly.

### Step 2 — Select Framework

Choose the framework based on what is unknown about the problem:

| Situation | Framework |
|-----------|-----------|
| Root cause is unknown — symptoms are clear | **5 Whys** |
| Multiple potential causes from different domains | **Fishbone (Ishikawa)** |
| Standard assumptions need challenging | **First Principles** |
| Creative options needed for a known problem | **SCAMPER** |
| Must prioritize among known solutions | **Impact Matrix** |

State which framework was selected and why.

### Step 3 — Apply Framework

Execute the selected framework with discipline:

**5 Whys:**
- Why did [problem] occur? → [answer 1]
- Why did [answer 1] occur? → [answer 2]
- Why did [answer 2] occur? → [answer 3]
- Why did [answer 3] occur? → [answer 4]
- Why did [answer 4] occur? → [root cause]
- Stop at 5 or when root cause cannot be decomposed further

**Fishbone (Ishikawa):**
- Categorize potential causes into: People, Process, Technology, Environment
- Under each category, list contributing factors with evidence
- Identify which category has the highest concentration of causes

**First Principles:**
- List all current assumptions about the problem
- Challenge each assumption: "Is this actually true?"
- Strip to fundamental facts that cannot be disputed
- Rebuild solution from those fundamentals upward

**SCAMPER:**
- Substitute: what can be replaced?
- Combine: what can be merged?
- Adapt: what can be adjusted from another context?
- Modify/Magnify: what can be scaled or emphasized?
- Put to other use: what can serve a different purpose?
- Eliminate: what can be removed?
- Reverse/Rearrange: what can be flipped?

**Impact Matrix:**
- List all candidate solutions
- Score each on Impact (1-5) and Effort (1-5)
- Rank by Impact/Effort ratio descending

### Step 4 — Generate Solutions

From the framework output, derive 2-3 actionable solutions. For each solution:
- Describe what to do concretely
- Estimate impact: high / medium / low
- Estimate effort: high / medium / low
- State any preconditions or risks

Rank solutions by impact/effort ratio.

### Step 5 — Report

Return the full analysis in the output format below.

## Constraints

- Never skip the framework — the structure is the value of this skill
- Use Sonnet, not Haiku — reasoning depth matters here
- If problem is underspecified, state assumptions explicitly before proceeding
- Do not produce more than 3 recommended solutions — prioritize quality over quantity

## Output Format

```
## Analysis: [Problem Statement]
- **Framework**: [chosen framework and reason]
- **Confidence**: high | medium | low

### Reasoning Chain
1. [step with evidence or reasoning]
2. [step with evidence or reasoning]
3. [step with evidence or reasoning]
...

### Root Cause / Core Finding
[what the framework reveals as the fundamental issue or conclusion]

### Recommended Solutions (ranked)
1. **[Solution Name]** — Impact: high/medium/low | Effort: high/medium/low
   [concrete description of what to do]
2. **[Solution Name]** — Impact: high/medium/low | Effort: high/medium/low
   [concrete description of what to do]
3. **[Solution Name]** — Impact: high/medium/low | Effort: high/medium/low
   [concrete description of what to do]

### Next Action
[single most important immediate step]

## Cost Profile

~500-1500 tokens input, ~500-1000 tokens output. Sonnet for reasoning quality.
