# preflight

## Purpose

<HARD-GATE>
Preflight verdict of BLOCK stops the pipeline. The calling skill (cook, deploy, launch) MUST halt until all BLOCK findings are resolved and preflight re-runs clean.
</HARD-GATE>

Pre-commit quality gate that catches "almost right" code — the kind that compiles and passes linting but has logic errors, missing error handling, or incomplete implementations. Goes beyond static analysis to check data flow, edge cases, async correctness, and regression impact. The last defense before code enters the repository.

## Triggers

- Called automatically by `cook` before commit phase
- Called by `fix` after applying fixes (verify fix quality)
- `/rune preflight` — manual quality check
- Auto-trigger: when staged changes exceed 100 LOC

## Calls (outbound)

- `scout` (L2): find code affected by changes (dependency tracing)
- `sentinel` (L2): security sub-check on changed files
- `hallucination-guard` (L3): verify imports and API references exist
- `test` (L2): run test suite as pre-commit check

## Called By (inbound)

- `cook` (L1): before commit phase — mandatory gate

## Check Categories

```
LOGIC       — data flow errors, edge case misses, async bugs
ERROR       — missing try/catch, bare catches, unhelpful error messages
REGRESSION  — untested impact zones, breaking changes to public API
COMPLETE    — missing validation, missing loading states, missing tests
SECURITY    — delegated to sentinel
IMPORTS     — delegated to hallucination-guard
```

## Executable Steps

### Step 1 — Logic Review
Use `Read` to load each changed file. For every modified function or method:
- Trace the data flow from input to output. Identify where a `null`, `undefined`, empty array, or 0 value would cause a runtime error or wrong result.
- Check async/await: every `async` function that calls an async operation must `await` it. Identify missing `await` that would cause race conditions or unhandled promise rejections.
- Check boundary conditions: off-by-one in loops, array index out of bounds, division by zero.
- Check type coercions: implicit `==` comparisons that could produce wrong results, string-to-number conversions without validation.

Flag each issue with: file path, line number, category (null-deref | missing-await | off-by-one | type-coerce), and a one-line description.

### Step 2 — Error Handling
For every changed file, verify:
- Every `async` function has a `try/catch` block OR the caller explicitly handles the rejected promise.
- No bare `catch(e) {}` or `except: pass` — every catch must log or rethrow with context.
- Every `fetch` / HTTP client call checks the response status before consuming the body.
- Error messages are user-friendly: no raw stack traces, no internal variable names exposed to the client.
- API route handlers return appropriate HTTP status codes (4xx for client errors, 5xx for server errors).

Flag each violation with: file path, line number, category (bare-catch | missing-status-check | raw-error-exposure), and description.

### Step 3 — Regression Check
Use `rune:scout` to identify all files that import or depend on the changed files/functions.
For each dependent file:
- Check if the changed function signature is still compatible (parameter count, types, return type).
- Check if the dependent file has tests that cover the interaction with the changed code.
- Flag untested impact zones: dependents with zero test coverage of the affected code path.

Flag each regression risk with: dependent file path, what changed, whether tests exist, severity (breaking | degraded | untested).

### Step 4 — Completeness Check
Verify that new code ships complete:
- New API endpoint → has input validation schema (Zod, Pydantic, Joi, etc.)
- New React/Svelte component → has loading state AND error state
- New feature → has at least one test file
- New configuration option → has documentation (inline comment or docs file)
- New database query → has corresponding migration file if schema changed

If any completeness item is missing, flag as **WARN** with: what is missing, which file needs it.

### Step 5 — Security Sub-Check
Invoke `rune:sentinel` on the changed files. Attach sentinel's output verbatim under the "Security" section of the preflight report. If sentinel returns BLOCK, preflight verdict is also BLOCK.

### Step 6 — Generate Verdict
Aggregate all findings:
- Any BLOCK from sentinel OR a logic issue that would cause data corruption or security bypass → overall **BLOCK**
- Any missing error handling, regression risk with no tests, or incomplete feature → **WARN**
- Only style or best-practice suggestions → **PASS**

Report PASS, WARN, or BLOCK. For WARN, list each item the developer must acknowledge. For BLOCK, list each item that must be fixed before proceeding.

## Output Format

```
## Preflight Report
- **Status**: PASS | WARN | BLOCK
- **Files Checked**: [count]
- **Changes**: +[added] -[removed] lines across [files] files

### Logic Issues
- `path/to/file.ts:42` — null-deref: `user.name` accessed without null check
- `path/to/api.ts:85` — missing-await: async database call not awaited

### Error Handling
- `path/to/handler.ts:20` — bare-catch: error swallowed silently

### Regression Risk
- `utils/format.ts` — changed function used by 5 modules, 2 have tests, 3 untested (WARN)

### Completeness
- `api/users.ts` — new POST endpoint missing input validation schema
- `components/Form.tsx` — no loading state during submission

### Security (from sentinel)
- [sentinel findings if any]

### Verdict
WARN — 3 issues found (0 blocking, 3 must-acknowledge). Resolve before commit or explicitly acknowledge each WARN.
```

## Constraints

1. MUST check: logic errors, error handling, edge cases, type safety, naming conventions
2. MUST reference specific file:line for every finding
3. MUST NOT skip edge case analysis — "happy path works" is insufficient
4. MUST verify error messages are user-friendly and don't leak internal details
5. MUST check that async operations have proper error handling and cleanup

## Cost Profile

~2000-4000 tokens input, ~500-1500 tokens output. Sonnet for logic analysis quality.
