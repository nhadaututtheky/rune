# watchdog

## Purpose

Post-deploy monitoring setup. Configures error tracking (Sentry), health endpoints, alert rules, and smoke tests. Ensures deployed applications are monitored and issues are caught quickly.

## Triggers

- Called by deploy after successful deployment
- Called by launch for monitoring setup

## Calls (outbound)

None — pure L3 utility.

## Called By (inbound)

- `deploy` (L2): post-deploy monitoring setup
- `launch` (L1): monitoring as part of launch pipeline

## Capabilities

```
MONITORING      — Sentry integration, error tracking setup
HEALTH ENDPOINT — generate /health and /ready endpoints
ALERT RULES     — error rate, response time, uptime thresholds
SMOKE TEST      — verify critical endpoints after deploy
```

## Output Format

```
## Watchdog Setup
- **Monitoring**: [configured | skipped]
- **Health Endpoint**: [path]
- **Alerts**: [count rules configured]

### Smoke Test Results
- [endpoint] — [status] ([response time]ms)

### Alert Rules
- Error rate > 1% → alert
- Response time > 2s → alert
- Uptime < 99.9% → alert
```

## Cost Profile

~500-1500 tokens input, ~300-800 tokens output. Sonnet for configuration quality.
