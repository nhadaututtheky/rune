# Rune

**Less skills. Deeper connections.**

A lean, interconnected skill ecosystem for Claude Code that covers the full project lifecycle — from idea to revenue.

## Why Rune?

Most skill ecosystems are either **too many isolated skills** (540+ that don't talk to each other) or **rigid pipelines** (A → B → C, if B fails everything stops).

Rune is a **mesh** — 36 skills with 115 connections. Skills call each other bidirectionally, forming resilient workflows that adapt when things go wrong.

```
Pipeline:  A → B → C → D         (B fails = stuck)
Hub-Spoke: A → HUB → C           (HUB fails = stuck)
Mesh:      A ↔ B ↔ C             (B fails = A reaches C via D→E)
           ↕       ↕
           D ↔ E ↔ F
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install the plugin
claude plugin add rune

# Onboard any project (generates CLAUDE.md + .rune/ context)
/rune onboard

# Build a feature (full TDD cycle)
/rune cook "add user authentication with JWT"

# Debug an issue
/rune debug "login returns 401 for valid credentials"

# Security scan before commit
/rune sentinel

# Refactor legacy code safely
/rune rescue

# Full project health audit
/rune audit
```

### Layer Rules

| Layer | Can Call | Called By | State |
|-------|---------|----------|-------|
| L1 Orchestrators | L2, L3 | User only | Stateful (workflow) |
| L2 Workflow Hubs | L2 (cross-hub), L3 | L1, L2 | Stateful (task) |
| L3 Utilities | Nothing (pure) | L1, L2 | Stateless |
| L4 Extensions | L3 | L2 (domain match) | Config-based |

### Cost Intelligence

Every skill has an auto-selected model for optimal cost:

| Task Type | Model | Cost |
|-----------|-------|------|
| Scan, search, validate | Haiku | Cheapest |
| Write code, fix bugs, review | Sonnet | Default |
| Architecture, security audit | Opus | Deep reasoning |

Typical feature: ~$0.05-0.15 (vs ~$0.60 all-opus).

## Key Workflows

### `/rune cook` — Build a Feature

```
Phase 1 UNDERSTAND → scout scans codebase
Phase 2 PLAN       → plan creates implementation steps
Phase 3 TEST       → test writes failing tests (TDD red)
Phase 4 IMPLEMENT  → fix writes code (TDD green)
Phase 5 QUALITY    → preflight + sentinel + review
Phase 6 VERIFY     → verification + hallucination-guard
Phase 7 COMMIT     → git commit with semantic message
Phase 8 BRIDGE     → session-bridge saves state
```

### `/rune rescue` — Refactor Legacy Code

```
Phase 0 RECON      → autopsy assesses damage (health score)
Phase 1 SAFETY NET → safeguard writes characterization tests
Phase 2-N SURGERY  → surgeon refactors 1 module per session
Phase N+1 CLEANUP  → remove @legacy markers
Phase N+2 VERIFY   → health score comparison (before vs after)
```

### `/rune launch` — Deploy + Market

```
Phase 1 PRE-FLIGHT → full test suite
Phase 2 DEPLOY     → push to platform
Phase 3 VERIFY     → live site checks + monitoring
Phase 4 MARKET     → landing copy, social, SEO
Phase 5 ANNOUNCE   → publish content
```

## Mesh Resilience

If a skill fails, the mesh adapts:

| If this fails... | Rune tries... |
|---|---|
| debug can't find cause | problem-solver (different reasoning) |
| docs-seeker can't find docs | research (broader web search) |
| scout can't find files | research + docs-seeker |
| test can't run | deploy fix env, then test again |

Loop prevention: max 2 visits per skill, max chain depth 8.

## Cross-Session Persistence

Rune preserves context across sessions via `.rune/`:

```
.rune/
├── decisions.md     — architectural decisions log
├── conventions.md   — established patterns & style
├── progress.md      — task progress tracker
└── session-log.md   — brief session history
```

Every new session loads `.rune/` automatically — zero context loss.
