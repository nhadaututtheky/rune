## 1. Why Rune Exists

The problem is not that developers lack AI tools. The problem is that AI tools behave like interns with amnesia — capable, but stateless, siloed, and unable to hand work off cleanly.

Three specific failures motivated Rune:

**Failure 1: Isolation.** Most skill ecosystems are collections, not systems. 500+ skills exist that don't know each other. When `debug` finds a root cause, nothing hands that diagnosis to `fix`. The developer becomes the integration layer — which defeats the purpose of AI tooling.

**Failure 2: Fragility.** Pipeline-based tools (A→B→C) break at every seam. If B fails, everything stops. There's no mesh, no alternative path, no resilience. One broken step means starting over.

**Failure 3: Amnesia.** Each session starts from zero. The AI re-discovers conventions, re-reads the codebase, re-asks questions that were answered two sessions ago. Context dies at the end of every conversation.

**Rune's insight:** the value is in the connections, not the nodes. A mesh of 40 well-connected skills outperforms 500 isolated ones. Resilience comes from redundant paths. Memory comes from structured persistence. The goal is not to give developers more AI tools — it's to give them an AI that behaves like a senior engineer who was actually there last week.

## 2. What Rune Is

Rune is a **skill mesh** — not a skill collection, not a pipeline, not an AI agent framework.

**Technical definition:**

> **Rune = 40 skills × 139+ bidirectional connections × cross-session memory**

All three components are equally essential:
- Remove connections → becomes a collection (The Bloat wins)
- Remove memory → becomes a stateless chatbot
- Remove skills → nothing remains

**Rune operates on mesh principles:**
- Every skill knows who to call when it hits the edge of its scope
- When a skill fails, the mesh finds an alternate path — it does not stop
- Skills pass structured output to each other; the developer is not the integration layer
- Context flows in one direction: L1 holds the full picture, L2 gets a relevant slice, L3 gets a minimal query

**Rune serves the complete development lifecycle:** idea → design → code → quality → deploy → rescue. Not a tool for one phase. A system for all of them.

**The mesh is the product.** A new skill that doesn't increase connection density is not a Rune skill — it's a feature that happens to live in the same repo.

## 3. What Rune Is NOT

*This is where The Bloat gets defeated.*

**The Bloat** is the persistent temptation to add features that seem useful in isolation but erode Rune's identity as a mesh. The Bloat speaks in reasonable-sounding arguments: *"users would love this"*, *"it only takes 50 lines"*, *"it's just one more skill."* The Bloat is not wrong about usefulness. It is wrong about what Rune is for.

### Anti-Goals

**Rune is NOT a general-purpose AI assistant.**
`email-writer`, `meeting-summarizer`, `travel-planner` — these are not development lifecycle skills. They don't connect to the mesh. A user asking Rune to write an email has the wrong mental model of what Rune is. We do not want to correct that mental model by adding email skills; we want to reinforce the correct one.

**Rune is NOT a skill marketplace.**
More skills ≠ more value. The benchmark is not "how many skills does Rune have?" It is "what is the average connection depth of each skill?" A skill with 0 inbound and 0 outbound connections is a dead node. Dead nodes dilute the mesh.

**Rune is NOT an IDE or code editor.**
Rune does not manage files directly, run terminal sessions, or provide a UI. It operates through Claude Code's existing tooling. Rune extends Claude's reasoning — it does not replace the environment.

**Rune is NOT a replacement for the developer.**
Rune amplifies developer judgment, not replaces it. `cook` presents a plan and waits for approval before writing code. `brainstorm` proposes options, not decisions. The developer remains in the loop at every consequential step. Rune without a developer at the helm is half a system.

**Rune is NOT a pipeline.**
`cook` is not a rigid A→B→C→D sequence that fails if one step breaks. It's a mesh-orchestrated workflow where each phase can invoke any skill needed, retry via alternatives, and skip phases that don't apply. If someone tries to build a Rune skill as a strict sequential pipeline with no branching — they've misunderstood the architecture.

**Rune is NOT trying to cover every programming language or domain at the core layer.**
That's what L4 extension packs are for. The core (L1-L3) is language-agnostic. Domain specifics (React patterns, Rust idioms, trading algorithms) belong in L4. Adding language-specific logic to L1-L3 is scope creep disguised as helpfulness.

## 4. Design Principles

These are the rules that govern every decision in Rune — skill design, connection design, naming, layer assignment, model selection. When two options conflict, these principles break the tie.

### P1 — Connection Density Over Feature Count

Every new skill must increase the total mesh connection density, not just add a node. Before adding a skill, count its inbound + outbound connections. A skill with fewer than 2 connections is a dead node.

**Test:** *"If I remove this skill, how many workflows break?"* If the answer is zero, the skill should not exist.

### P2 — Structured Output Is a Contract

Skills communicate through structured, predictable output formats — not natural language summaries. A skill's `## Output Format` section is a contract with callers. Changing it is a breaking change. Natural language output that cannot be parsed by a calling skill is a design failure.

**Test:** *"Can `cook` consume this skill's output without re-reading the context?"* If no, fix the output format.

### P3 — Fail Loud, Route Around

When a skill fails, it must fail loudly (specific error, not silent empty output) so the mesh can route around it. Silent failures are the most dangerous failure mode — the calling skill proceeds with incomplete data.

**Test:** *"If this skill returns nothing, does the caller know something went wrong?"* If no, add explicit error output.

### P4 — Layer Discipline Is Non-Negotiable

L3 utilities do not call L1 or L2. L1 orchestrators do not implement business logic directly — they delegate to L2. This is not a suggestion; it's what makes the mesh predictable. Violating layer discipline for "just this one case" introduces coupling that spreads.

**Test:** *"Is this skill calling something above its layer?"* If yes, restructure. No exceptions.

### P5 — The Mesh Is More Valuable Than Any Single Skill

No skill is indispensable. If a skill consistently causes issues (wrong model, bad output format, poor connections), replace or remove it. Protecting a skill because it was hard to build is The Bloat thinking. The mesh's health matters more than any individual node.

**Test:** *"Would removing this skill and re-routing its callers make the mesh stronger?"* If yes, remove it.

### P6 — Constraints Block Rationalization

Behavioral constraints (MUST/MUST NOT rules) exist to prevent the most common AI failure mode: rationalization. The AI will always find a reason to skip a step, abbreviate a check, or declare success without verification. Constraints don't suggest — they block. If a constraint can be argued away, it is not a constraint; it's a guideline.

**Test:** *"Can the AI talk itself out of following this constraint?"* If yes, rewrite it to be more specific.

### P7 — Cost Is a Feature

Model selection is a design decision, not an afterthought. Haiku for scans. Sonnet for code. Opus for architecture and security. Using opus for a file glob is waste. Using haiku for a security audit is negligence. Every skill's `## Cost Profile` is a design constraint, not documentation.

**Test:** *"Is this skill using the cheapest model that can do the job correctly?"* If not, downgrade.

---

## 5. The Skill Addition Filter

*Use this checklist every time a new skill is proposed — by the team, by users, or by an AI session that thinks "we should add X."*

A proposed skill must pass **all 5 gates** to be added to the core mesh (L1-L3). L4 extension packs have a lighter filter (gates 1 and 5 only).

### Gate 1 — Lifecycle Fit
> Does this skill serve the software development lifecycle?

The skill must fit one of these phases: planning, coding, testing, reviewing, deploying, monitoring, rescuing. If it primarily serves a non-development task (communication, content, business ops), it belongs outside Rune's core — possibly as a user's private skill.

❌ **Fail example:** `slack-notifier` — communication, not development
✅ **Pass example:** `audit` — project health assessment, fits the quality phase

### Gate 2 — Connection Requirement
> Does this skill have ≥2 meaningful mesh connections (inbound + outbound combined)?

A skill must either call at least one existing skill OR be called by at least two existing skills — and ideally both. Connections must be meaningful (actual data flow), not ceremonial.

❌ **Fail example:** `code-formatter` — no inbound, no outbound, pure L3 with 0 connections
✅ **Pass example:** `audit` — calls `sentinel`, `dependency-doctor`, `autopsy`, `scout`, `journal`; called by `cook`, `launch`

### Gate 3 — Non-Redundancy
> Can this skill's function be achieved by composing 2 existing skills?

If yes, add a new workflow to an existing skill instead of creating a new one. Rune's philosophy is deepening connections in existing skills before adding new nodes.

❌ **Fail example:** `quick-security-check` — just `sentinel` with fewer checks; redundant
✅ **Pass example:** `audit` — orchestrates multiple skills into a unified 7-phase report; not achievable by a single existing skill

### Gate 4 — Layer Assignment
> Is the correct layer assignment clear and unambiguous?

If it's unclear whether the skill should be L1, L2, or L3 — that's a signal the skill's scope is not well-defined yet. Clarify the scope first.

L3 if: stateless, single-purpose, no orchestration
L2 if: workflow with multiple steps, may call other skills
L1 if: full lifecycle orchestration, user-facing entry point

### Gate 5 — The Removal Test
> If this skill is removed in 6 months, does the mesh lose something irreplaceable?

This test separates essential skills from convenience features. If the skill's absence could be worked around trivially, it's not core.

❌ **Fail example:** `git-log-formatter` — convenience wrapper; absence has no workflow impact
✅ **Pass example:** `sentinel` — no other skill provides security scanning; its absence leaves a critical gap

## 6. Roadmap Horizons

Rune operates on three time horizons. The roadmap is intentionally non-prescriptive about dates — Rune is a solo/small-team project and date-driven roadmaps create pressure to ship The Bloat.

### H1 — Consolidation (Now)

**Goal:** Make the 40 existing skills excellent before adding more.

- Deepen mesh connections: audit every skill's `## Calls` and `## Called By` for accuracy
- Harden behavioral constraints: identify constraints that can be rationalized away and rewrite them
- Validate L4 extension packs: ensure all 12 packs have complete, executable `PACK.md` files
- Publish to Claude Code plugin marketplace

**Constraint:** No new L1-L3 core skills until Consolidation is complete. L4 packs are allowed.

### H2 — Ecosystem (Next)

**Goal:** Make Rune extensible by others without compromising the core mesh.

- Community L4 extension packs: documented contribution process, review criteria
- Plugin versioning: semver for skill APIs so callers don't break on updates
- Skill testing framework: automated validation of mesh connections and output format contracts
- `rune:onboard` generates project-specific L4 suggestions based on detected stack

**Constraint:** Core mesh (L1-L3) is frozen at ≤40 skills. Growth happens in L4.

### H3 — Intelligence (Later)

**Goal:** Make the mesh self-aware and self-improving.

- Mesh analytics: which skill chains are used most? Which skills have the worst failure rates?
- Adaptive routing: if `debug` consistently fails for a specific error type, `cook` learns to route to `problem-solver` first
- Skill performance metrics: cost per invocation, success rate, average chain depth
- Community skill sharing: users can publish and install community L4 packs via `claude plugin add @community/rune-xxx`

**Constraint:** H3 features require runtime infrastructure that doesn't exist yet. Do not design for H3 during H1.

---

## 7. Success Metrics

*Rune is successful when these are true. Not when the feature list is long.*

### Mesh Health
- **Connection density** ≥ 3.0 connections/skill (currently: 3.5) — do not let this drop below 2.5
- **Dead nodes** = 0 — every skill has ≥1 inbound and ≥1 outbound connection
- **Max chain depth used** < 6 in practice (ceiling is 8) — if chains regularly hit 8, the mesh needs restructuring

### Behavioral Quality
- **Constraint coverage** = 100% — every skill has a `## Constraints` section
- **HARD-GATE consistency** — all hard gates use `<HARD-GATE>` XML format, none can be silently bypassed
- **Output format coverage** = 100% — every skill has a structured `## Output Format`

### Developer Experience
- A developer can go from `/rune onboard` to first working feature with `/rune cook` in one session
- A developer can pick up work across sessions with zero manual context re-loading (`.rune/` handles it)
- The most common workflows (`cook`, `debug`, `rescue`) work without reading any documentation

### The Bloat Index
*This is the most important metric.*

> **Bloat Index = dead nodes / total skills**

Target: **0.00**. If any skill has 0 inbound AND 0 outbound connections, it is dead weight. Review quarterly and remove or reconnect.

## Appendix: The Bloat's Greatest Hits

*A record of feature requests and ideas that The Bloat has whispered — and why they were rejected.*

| Proposal | The Bloat's argument | Why rejected |
|----------|---------------------|--------------|
| `code-formatter` | "Devs always need formatting" | 0 mesh connections. Use the project's existing linter instead. |
| `email-writer` | "Devs write emails about their code all the time" | Not a development lifecycle task. Wrong product category. |
| `quick-fix` | "Sometimes `fix` is overkill" | Redundant. Use `fix` with a narrow scope. Don't duplicate skills. |
| `explain-code` | "Junior devs need code explained" | Claude's base capability handles this. No mesh value added by wrapping it in a skill. |
| `changelog-generator` | "Every project needs changelogs" | `journal` + `session-bridge` + a git log command covers this. Non-core. |

*When The Bloat returns with a new proposal — and it will — add it here with the rejection reason. This log is part of the VISION.*
