# Rune Architecture

## 4-Layer Model

| Layer | Name | Count | Can Call | Called By | State |
|-------|------|-------|----------|----------|-------|
| L1 | Orchestrators | 4 | L2, L3 | User only | Stateful (workflow) |
| L2 | Workflow Hubs | 20 | L2 (cross-hub), L3 | L1, L2 | Stateful (task) |
| L3 | Utilities | 16 | Nothing (pure)* | L1, L2 | Stateless |
| L4 | Extension Packs | 12 | L3 | L2 (domain match) | Config-based |

### Exceptions

- `team` (L1) can call other L1 orchestrators — meta-orchestration pattern.
- *L3→L3 coordination: `context-engine` → `session-bridge`, `hallucination-guard` → `research` (documented in SKILL.md).

## Mesh Protocol

### Loop Prevention

```
Rule 1: No self-calls (history[-1] !== target)
Rule 2: Max 2 visits to same skill per chain
Rule 3: Max chain depth: 8
Rule 4: If blocked → escalate to L1 orchestrator
```

### Model Auto-Selection

```
Read-only / scan?           → haiku   (cheapest)
Write / edit / generate?    → sonnet  (default)
Architecture / security?    → opus    (deep reasoning)

Override: priority=critical → always opus
Override: budget constraint → downgrade
Override: user preference   → manual in config
```

### Parallel Execution

| Context | Max Parallel | Reason |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| L3 utilities (haiku) | 5 | Cheap, fast, independent |
| L2 hubs (sonnet) | 3 | Moderate cost, may share context |
| L1 orchestrators | 1 | Only one orchestrator at a time |

### Error Handling & Resilience

| If this fails... | Try this instead... |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| debug can't find cause | problem-solver (different reasoning) |
| docs-seeker can't find | research (broader web search) |
| browser-pilot can't capture | verification (CLI checks) |
| scout can't find files | research + docs-seeker |
| test can't run (env broken) | deploy fix env → test again |
| review finds too many issues | plan re-scope → fix priorities |

## Skill Groups

## Cross-Hub Mesh (L2 ↔ L2)

```
plan ↔ brainstorm     (creative ↔ structure)
fix ↔ debug           (fix ↔ root cause)
test → debug          (unexpected failure)
review → test         (untested edge case found)
review → fix          (bug found during review)
fix → test            (verify after fix)
deploy → test         (pre-deploy verification)
debug → scout         (find related code)
marketing → scout     (analyze assets)
plan → scout          (scan before planning)
fix → review          (self-review complex fix)
review → scout        (more context needed)
surgeon → safeguard   (untested module found)
preflight → sentinel  (security sub-check)
audit → sentinel      (security phase delegation)
audit → autopsy       (complexity/health phase)
audit → dependency-doctor (deps phase delegation)
audit → scout         (discovery phase)
audit → journal       (save audit report)

# perf
perf ← cook           (Phase 5 quality gate)
perf ← audit          (performance dimension delegation)
perf ← review         (performance patterns detected in diff)
perf ← deploy         (pre-deploy perf regression check)
perf → scout          (find hotpath files)
perf → browser-pilot  (Lighthouse / Core Web Vitals)
perf → verification   (run benchmark scripts if configured)

# db
db ← cook             (schema change detected in diff)
db ← deploy           (pre-deploy migration safety check)
db ← audit            (database health dimension)
db → scout            (find schema/migration files)
db → verification     (run migration in test env)
db → hallucination-guard (verify SQL syntax and ORM methods)

# incident
incident ← launch     (watchdog alerts during Phase 3 VERIFY)
incident ← deploy     (health check fails post-deploy)
incident → watchdog   (current system state — what's down)
incident → autopsy    (root cause after containment)
incident → journal    (record incident timeline)
incident → sentinel   (check for security dimension)

# design
design ← cook         (frontend task detected, no design-system.md)
design ← review       (AI anti-pattern detected in diff)
design ← perf         (Lighthouse Accessibility BLOCK)
design → scout        (detect platform, tokens, component library)
design → asset-creator (generate base visual assets from design system)
```

## Context Bus

Each workflow maintains a shared context managed by L1:

```
L1: full bus (complete picture)
L2: relevant subset (only what they need)
L3: minimal query (stateless, no history)
L4: domain-filtered subset
```
